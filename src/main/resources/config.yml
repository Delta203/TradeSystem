# TradeSystem
# Plugin by Delta203
# v1.20.1 Spigot, Java 17

# Coin system interface
# You already need a coin system that can be accessed by an 
# interface. Without this, it is not possible to trade coins. 
# As soon as this is selected and the correct data has been 
# entered, you can trade coins. Make sure that type file always
# requires a command to set the player coins.
# Interface types:
#   mysql       | Connect a MySQl database
#   file        | Connect a YAML file
# Data types:
#   int         | integer (default)
#   double      | double
# Placeholders:
#   %uuid%      | player uuid
#   %player%    | player name
#   %coins%     | amount of coins (e.g. /addcoins foo %coins%)
#   %COINS%     | amount of player coins + traded coins (e.g. /setcoins foo %COINS%)
